**Introduction**

At Creative Pixels, a prominent UI/UX design agency, the goal is to continuously enhance the performance and efficiency of design projects while ensuring high client satisfaction. To achieve this, we aim to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor, analyze, and improve the performance of ongoing UI/UX projects. The dashboard will serve as a comprehensive tool for tracking various metrics related to project progress, team productivity, resource allocation, and client satisfaction.

By utilizing this dashboard, Creative Pixels will streamline its project delivery timelines, optimize its design processes, and improve overall client satisfaction. The real-time data and interactive features of the dashboard will also support data-driven decision-making, thus allowing the agency to identify inefficiencies, allocate resources more effectively, and deliver exceptional results to clients.

Team Productivity: Track the productivity levels of design teams, including hours worked, tasks completed, and sprint velocity.

Resource Allocation: Analyze resource utilization, including the distribution of tasks among team members, availability of design tools, and workload balancing.

Client Satisfaction: Evaluate client feedback and satisfaction through metrics such as survey results, ratings, and post-project reviews.

Project Delivery Timelines: Measure how efficiently projects are being delivered in terms of time, comparing actual timelines to planned milestones.
